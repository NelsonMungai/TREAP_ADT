The is a DSA that performs insertion and deletion in a priority queue using time complexity of O(logn) heaps achieve this by using binary trees

## Heap 
is a binary tree that stores a collection of items at its positions and that satisfies two additional properties.
1. Relational property define in terms of the way keys are sorted in T

-In a heap T,for every position p other than the root,the key stored at p is greater than or equal to key stored at p's parent
2. Structural property defined in terms of the shape of T itself

 -->A heap T, with height h is complete if levels 0,1...h-1 of T have the max number of nodes possible (2^i nodes) for 0<=i<=h-1 and the remaining nodes at level h reside in the leftmost possible positions at that level.
